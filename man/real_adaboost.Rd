\arguments{
\item{x_train}{feature matrix.}

\item{y_train}{a factor class variable. Boosting algorithm allows for
k >= 2. However, not all classifiers are capable of multiclass
classification.}

\item{classifier}{pre-ready or a custom classifier function. Pre-ready
classifiers are "rpart", "glm", "gnb", "dnb", "earth".}

\item{predictor}{prediction function for classifier. It's output must be a
factor variable with the same levels of y_train}

\item{x_test}{optional test feature matrix. Can be used instead of predict
function. print_detail and print_plot gives information about test.}

\item{y_test}{optional a factor test class variable with the same levels as
y_train. Can be used instead of predict function. print_detail and print_plot
gives information about test.}

\item{weighted_bootstrap}{If classifier does not support case weights,
weighted_bootstrap must be TRUE used for weighting. If classifier supports
weights, it must be FALSE. default is FALSE.}

\item{max_iter}{maximum number of iterations. Default to 30. Probably should
be higher for classifiers other than decision tree.}

\item{lambda}{a parameter for model weights. Default to 1. Higher values
leads to unstable weak classifiers, which is good sometimes. Lower values
leads to slower fitting.}

\item{print_detail}{a logical for printing errors for each iteration.
Default to TRUE}

\item{print_plot}{a logical for plotting errors. Default to FALSE.}

\item{bag_frac}{a value between 0 and 1. It represents the proportion of
cases to be used in each iteration. Smaller datasets may be better to create
weaker classifiers. 1 means all cases. Default to 0.5. Ignored if
\code{weighted_bootstrap == TRUE}.}

\item{p_weak}{number of variables to use in weak classifiers. It is the
number of columns in \code{x_train} by default. Lower values lead to weaker
classifiers.}

\item{...}{additional arguments for classifier and predictor functions.
weak classifiers.}

\item{method}{"discrete" or "real" for Discrete or Real Adaboost.}

\description{
This function allows you to use any classifier to be used in
Discrete or Real AdaBoost framework.

\details{
\code{method} can be "discrete" and "real" at the moment and indicates Discrete
AdaBoost and Real AdaBoost. For multiclass classification, "discrete" means SAMME,
"real" means SAMME.R algorithm.

Pre-ready classifiers are "rpart", "glm", "dnb", "gnb", "earth", which means
CART, logistic regression, Gaussian naive bayes, discrete naive bayes and MARS
classifier respectively.

\code{predictor} is valid only if a custom \code{classifier} function is
given. A custom classifier funtion should be as \code{function(x_train, y_train,
weights, ...)} and its output is a model object which can be placed in
\code{predictor}. \code{predictor} function is \code{function(model, x_new, type
...)} and its output must be a vector of class predictions. type must be "pred"
or "prob", which gives a vector of classes or a matrix of probabilities, which
each column represents each class. See \code{vignette("booster", package = "booster")}
for examples.

\code{lambda} is a multiplier of model weights.

\code{weighted_bootstrap} is for bootstrap sampling in each step. If the
classifier accepts case weights then it is better to turn it off. If classifier
does not accept case weights, then weighted bootstrap will make it into
weighted classifier using bootstrap. Learning may be slower this way.

\code{bag_frac} helps a classifier to be "weaker" by reducing sample
size. Stronger classifiers may require lower proportions of \code{bag_frac}.
\code{p_weak} does the same by reducing numbeer of variables.
